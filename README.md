## iOS App Showcase Features:

This tournament demonstrated advanced iOS development capabilities:
- **Modern SwiftUI Architecture**: All components use cutting-edge SwiftUI patterns
- **iOS Best Practices**: Following iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- **Complex State Management**: Advanced state handling with @State, @ObservedObject, etc.
- **Native iOS Integration**: Camera, location, and system services
- **Accessibility Support**: Full VoiceOver and accessibility features
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and user feedback

## Tournament Architecture:
- **ONE Repository:** All iOS component tournaments in a single repository
- **ONE Branch per Component:** Each iOS component has its own branch with full history
- **Sequential Tournaments:** LoginView → ProfileView → CameraView → ChatView → MapView
- **Parallel Agents:** Within each tournament, agents generate code in parallel
- **History Preservation:** Every agent's iOS implementation is committed and preserved
- **Winner Selection:** Best iOS implementation merges to main branch
